If you're reading this it's probably because you got an error message from Elsinore on Startup.

### I am trying to start Elsinore but it tells me I don't have any temperature probes!

Elsinore is a Temperature based PID controller, if you dont have a temperature probe, then you can't use the core functionality of Elsinore, so it will exit.

## But I want to test my pumps/SSRs/GPIO/puppy dog!

You should have a search for setting up and testing GPIO on Google, there are much better examples for testing your physical hardware. And you should test this stuff without Elsinore.

## Puppy Dog?

Don't give hops to your puppy. If you do, see a vet now, seriously, GO SEE A VET.

STOP READING THIS AND SEE A VET IF YOUR PUPPY ATE HOPS!
